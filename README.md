The IoTcraft mod allows the player's client to connect to an MQTT broker. Afterwards, it can send and receive messages in the form of commands, triggers or other methods defined by the user.

Requires [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/project/modmenu) and [owo-lib](https://modrinth.com/project/owo-lib) to function properly and for easy setup.
