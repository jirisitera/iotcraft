# IoTcraft
The IoTcraft mod allows the player's client to connect to an MQTT broker. Afterward, it can send and receive messages in the form of commands, triggers or other methods defined by the user.

## Requirements
Requires [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/project/fabric-api), [Cloth Config API](https://modrinth.com/project/cloth-config) and [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/project/modmenu) to function properly and for an easy setup.

## Setup
After booting up the game, navigate to the mod's config (either through the Mods button provided by Mod Menu or in the config folder) and set up the MQTT broker connection details.
